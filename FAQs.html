                <li><h2>What is Crypto?</h2></li>
                <h4><p>Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that operates on distributed ledger technology called a blockchain and uses cryptography for security. It is decentralized and operates independently of a central bank.</p>
                <p>Unlike traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies are not backed by a physical commodity or government, and their value is determined by market demand and supply. Cryptocurrencies can be used to buy goods and services, transfer funds, and trade in markets. Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Cronos.</p>
                <p>Many cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are created through a process called mining, which involves solving complex mathematical equations to validate and record transactions on a blockchain. This mechanism is also called Proof of Work (PoW). Another consensus mechanism that has increased in popularity — as it is more energy efficient — is Proof of Stake (PoS). Instead of mining, PoS relies on network participants validating transactions. Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency, uses this consensus mechanism.</p></h4>
                
                <li><h2>What is Bitcoin?</h2></li>
                <h4>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network. It was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, and it has gained significant popularity and value since its creation.
                <p>Unlike traditional fiat currency, which is controlled by central banks and governments, Bitcoin operates independently of any central authority. Transactions are verified and recorded on the blockchain, which is a distributed ledger that maintains a permanent and transparent record of all transactions.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin can be bought, sold, and exchanged on various cryptocurrency exchanges, and it can be used to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. The supply of bitcoins is limited to 21 million units, and new bitcoins are created through mining, which involves using specialized computer hardware to solve complex mathematical equations.</p>
                <p>Bitcoin is known for its high volatility, and its value can fluctuate rapidly in response to market conditions, news events, and other factors. Many traders, including institutional investors, see Bitcoin as a store of value and a way to participate in the growing cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p></h4>
